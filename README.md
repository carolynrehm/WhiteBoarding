solutions to practice whiteboarding/code challenge questions


1. Implement a method which returns the nth number of the fibannoci sequence 
    - part 2: Implement a method which returns an array of the fibannoci numbers up to the nth value 
2. Implement a utility method to print an array of int's
    - part 2: Implement a utility method which takes an array of a generic type and converts it to a string (without taking a parameter of Object[])
3. Implement a method which capitalizes the first letter of each word in a string
4. Implement a method which returns the value of n! when n is passed in as a parameter
5. *Implement a method which reverses a String 
    - challenge: do this using ONLY the charAt method (not using the length method, or any additional collections)
6. Given an array of ints, return an array of ints which contains the maximum number in the array, as many times as it accurs   
    > [2,3,5,1,5]->[5,5]
7. Given two Strings, return a boolean determining whether the second word is an anagram of the first 
8. Implement a method which removes duplicates from an integer array using core java only (no collections or utility classes)
9. Implement a method which takes in a 3x3 2D array representing a tic tac toe board; have a boolean return based on if there was a winner
10. *Given a string, find the longest sequence of contiguous characters and return the letter
    > 'aaaabbbcccdcccee' -> 'a'
11. *Separate an array into even numbers and odd numbers and give their count 
    > [2,3,5,1,5] prints "1 even, 4 odd"
12. *Given two arrays: [1, 2, 3]	[‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’] Combine them into one array (**note that these have different types…) 
14. *Write a program to count frequency of characters in an array
    > (['a','e','a','i'], 'a') -> 2
15. *Draw a Logical Data Model of IMDb
16. Draw a Logical Data Model of software a university might use for students to register for classes
